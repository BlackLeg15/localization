# Localization Example

### This project have a two examples: 
 - Home implementation;
 - Routes implementation;

Its settings are, respectively, in the files [main_home.dart](https://github.com/davidsdearaujo/localization/blob/master/example/lib/main_home.dart) and [main_routes.dart](https://github.com/davidsdearaujo/localization/blob/master/example/lib/main_routes.dart).

The [launch.json](https://github.com/davidsdearaujo/localization/blob/master/example/.vscode/launch.json) file helps to run each configuration separately in vscode.
